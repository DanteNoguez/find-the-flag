# Find the flag

A decision tree classifier —built with Sklearn— that determines whether a flag is from Europe or Oceania. I used the max_depth and ccp_alpha parameters to find the most accurate model, although accuracy didn't really improve by using cost-complexity pruning.

I haven't been listening to any music lately, but Everywhere I'll Ever Be by ELIZA dropped today so I listened to it a lot right before finishing the model.
